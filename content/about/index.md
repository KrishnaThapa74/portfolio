Hello! My name is Bishal, and I am a passionate Full Stack developer with a strong drive to create efficient, user-friendly, and innovative digital solutions. My journey in the world of programming began with a spark of curiosity, and it has since evolved into a relentless pursuit of mastering the art of crafting high-quality software.

From a young age, I found myself captivated by the limitless possibilities that coding offers. This fascination led me to embark on a dynamic learning path, where I have honed my skills in both front-end and back-end development. My toolkit includes a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, and tools, allowing me to seamlessly bridge the gap between design and functionality.


I am pursuing my Bachelors from [SVVV, Indore](https://www.svvv.edu.in/) in Computer Science and Engineering (2018-2022) my current GPA is [3.7]() out of 4.

I am a member of [Developer Student Club - SVVV](https://dsc.community.dev/shri-vaishnav-vidyapeeth-vishwavidyalaya/) and have also been awarded 75% Merit Scholarship(Top 10%) by my college.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently :
